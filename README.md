<h3>Features</h3>
Actual quest info on 16.2 quests, npc sprites, navigation info when you click on the npc for certain quests, proper quest icons for daily, episode, instance & event quests.
<h3>WiP Feature Tab improved <h3>
  I started Working on a more useful Feature tab to keep track of the episode quests, so far this is what i got

I'll keep working on it and will take suggestions on how in-depth to make these, you can submit suggestions on the iROQuest Feature Tab chat in FishDeity's discord [![FishDeity iRO GRF Edits](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/1149550005674328114/widget.png?style=shield)](https://discord.gg/UBjTpErdQU)
<h3>How to use it</h3>
Get OngoingQuestListInfo.lub from releases (https://github.com/ikatsuro/iroquest/releases)
Simply replace OngoingQuestListInfo.lub in System folder where the game is installed.
